## How to build:
If you want to build this project yourself (*or run it if you're not on Linux*), you'll need the latest version of <ins>Zig</ins>. You can find install instructions here: [Install](https://ziglang.org/download/).

Once Zig is installed, clone the repo using `git clone`. Once cloned, use `zig build run` to run the program or `zig build` to build the executable.
